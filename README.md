Assessment:
Write a simple cipher in javascript that takes a string as an argument and returns an encrypted text as well as takes encrypted text and returns the original text.

""In this read me file I will describe the process of the encryption...

Method of Cryptography:
Cryptography is classified into symmetric cryptography , asymmetric cryptography and hashing.

In private key, the same key (secret key) is used for both encryption and decryption. However, in public key, mathematically identical but different keys are used. One key (Public key) is used for encrypt the plain text to convert it into a cipher and another key (Private key) is used by receiver to decrypt the cipher text to read the message.

Solution to Problem: This solution utilizes the asymmetric cryptography approach in which there are two different keys i.e Public key and private key.
